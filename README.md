# assignment3_TwoVillages

## Overview

This Java assignment models two villages and the emperor's house, each with distinct attributes and visual representation. The program demonstrates object-oriented principles, including composition and encapsulation, and leverages JavaFX with FXGraphicsTemplate for graphical output.

## Features

- **Villages Modeling**: Each village contains three houses, all sharing the same color.
- **Emperor's House**: A unique, distinct house representing the emperor.
- **House Occupants**: Houses hold occupant data as part of their attributes.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Uses FXGraphicsTemplate to draw villages and houses, highlighting the differences between regular villages and the emperor's house.

## How It Works

- Two villages are created, each consisting of three colored houses.
- The emperor's house is generated with its own unique characteristics.
- All elements are rendered with FXGraphicsTemplate for easy visualization in the JavaFX window.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/whocodesjs/assignment3_TwoVillages.git
    cd assignment3_TwoVillages
    ```

2. Build or open the project in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.), making sure you have JavaFX configured.

3. Run the main application (update the class name if it is not `Main.java`):
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

## Project Structure

- `Village.java`: Models a village and manages its houses.
- `House.java`: Represents individual houses, including occupants and color.
- `EmperorHouse.java`: Models the emperor's unique house.
- `FXGraphicsTemplate.java`: Facilitates drawing components using JavaFX.
- `Main.java`: Sets up the application and launches the visual representation.
